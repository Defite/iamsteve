  	<article role="article" class="mb4">
    	<p class="mb4">Hello! I’m Steve, a designer who codes. I built my first website when I was around 12 in a school class using Microsoft Frontpage. I didn’t think too much of it, but it eventually became a hobby for me. Which led me to University, where I graduated in July 2011 and shortly after found a job. That’s me in summary.</p>
    	<h2 class="f4 mb2">Education</h2>
    	<p class="mb4">I studied web development, which people tend to find strange; as I consider myself a designer. However, the course was far from development focused. I believe the course is what you make of it and “web development” wouldn’t be considered an accurate reflection based on the work.</p>
    	<p>I focused on designing websites, this allowed me to gain better understanding of usability, information architecture and design as a whole. If I had taken a graphic design or art course, I wouldn’t have had access to making as many websites.</p>
    	<h2 class="f4 mb2">Specialising</h2>
  		<p class="mb4">As a designer, I enjoy the whole process, but specialise in user interface and user experience. I think the amount of years I have been doing this have helped me into a more unique position. I’m happy coding and designing equally, it helps make a better end product.</p>
  		<h2 class="f4 mb2">Learning</h2>
  		<p class="mb4">For me, if I don’t have anything to learn, I find myself getting bored quickly. I enjoy learning and putting it into practice. The things I’m aiming to be better at are illustration, hand lettering and JavaScript. I aspire to be as confident in illustration, as I am web design most of all.</p>
  		{!--<h2 class="f4 mb2">As a person</h2>
  		<p>I consider myself introverted until I know you. I’m pretty socially awkward, but I try not to let that get in the way too much. I don’t really shout about myself, post updates on twitter often about things I’ve done like others do and I respect those who do. It’s important.</p>--}

  	<article role="article" class="skills mb4 mb6-b">
  		<h2 class="f2 mb2">Skills & tools</h2>
  		<p class="mb4">I have a wide range of experience in different skills and tools, I’ve listed the ones I have most experience with and use on a daily basis.</p>
  		
  		<dl>
    		<dt>Design</dt>
    		<dd class="mb2">I primarily design for web, I believe aesthetics and user experience should be valued equally in the design world. I design for the audience and representing the brand best, but I appreciate designs that balance modernist principles without being ‘cold’. My advantage lies within being able to code, as a result I produce a design that is consistent across the website. I understand the value in good typography, colour and layout above all.</dd>
  			<dt>Photoshop</dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">Although it’s use isn’t as prolific as it used to be, it’s still a part of my workflow. You can’t beat it for quickly experimenting with ideas and getting the larger part of the way a website should look and feel.</dd>
  			<dt>Illustrator</dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">I’ve grown to love Illustrator for it’s SVG export and generally the way the web is going. I design websites quite equally between Illustrator and Photoshop. I’m not sure what I like best, so I couldn’t do without each.</dd>
  			<dt><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">The starting point for the coding side any website is generally getting into the HTML. So it’s obvious HTML should be in my skillset! I feel like this should be a given, but yes that includes HTML5 elements.</dd>
  			<dt><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">The stuff that makes a website come to life. I try to take a <abbr title="Don’t repeat yourself">DRY</abbr>ish approach to my CSS. I use <a href="http://sass-lang.com" title="Syntactically awesome stylesheets">Sass</a>. Another given I feel is I have great knowledge of CSS3. This means little for clients, but it helps me get my job done better.</dd>
  			<dt>JavaScript</dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">Always an area I’m looking to improve. Considering the majority of use cases you don’t reinvent the wheel to save time, I’m pretty handy with it. My aim is to always use it to enhance websites where necessary.</dd>
  			<dt>ExpressionEngine</dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">I love ExpressionEngine, it’s powerful in what it can do and a CMS which doesn’t get in my way. It doesn’t decide anything for me and lets me have full control over how <em>I</em> write the HTML. Which in turn helps me develop websites quicker! Also has a brilliant community behind it, you certainly get what you pay for.</dd>
  			<dt>Wordpress</dt>
  			<dd class="mb2">A highly dependable CMS, I’ve built the majority of websites on this. It’s a great way to manage a website and It’s got great plugins round it and you can pretty much build all websites on it, without too much of a problem.</dd>

V2 onwards have links to blog posts explaining decisions.</p>
