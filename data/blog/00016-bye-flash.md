summary: "John Gruber posted an article fairly recently about uninstalling Flash, I read it of course and found that it to be a logical thing to do. Now I’m not a big user of Chrome, but I’m more so annoyed by how much Flash can cause crashes in Safari and generally be slow, very slow. Here’s the original article. I was previous a user of Click to Flash a nice alternative to keep the Flash out, but as stated in the article mentioned Flash is still always running in the background."

John Gruber posted an article fairly recently about uninstalling Flash, I read it of course and found that it to be a logical thing to do. Now I'm not a big user of Chrome, but I'm more so annoyed by how much Flash can cause crashes in Safari and generally be slow, very slow. Here's the [original article](http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome "Flash free and cheating with Google Chrome"). I was previous a user of Click to Flash a nice alternative to keep the Flash out, but as stated in the article mentioned Flash is still always running in the background.

## Covering all grounds

I can settle for the times I need it to use Chrome, I thought which would be generally not too impacting, though that depends on how much I need to watch online. I'm a frequent user of [BBC iPlayer](http://bbc.co.uk/iplayer "Go to the BBC iPlayer website.") and [4od](http://channel4.com/4od "Go to the 4od website."), so my Chrome usage will be up a fair bit.

Missing Youtube? Easily covered for the most part I have the [Youtube5 Safari extension](http://www.verticalforest.com/2010/10/27/youtube5-version-2/ "A Safari extension that makes Youtube play videos in a HTML5 player.") and so far is doing the job greatly. It also has support for sites like Vimeo and Facebook.

## Improvements?

Overall it's too early to say, but switching between Chrome and Safari for the times I really do need Flash, I'm not arguing as it won't be a process still running when I'm done with Chrome. I do think it's going to be a helpful improvement for the battery and hopefully performance.

## Conclusion

While I wish I could be Flash free (unless it becomes more reliable and such), it's a nice alternative to not wonder if the page will crash when you know Flash will be there. Flash isn't going anywhere, yet, but if the alternatives weren't growing to Flash this wouldn't be possible. Let's hope it lasts, well I do anyway.
