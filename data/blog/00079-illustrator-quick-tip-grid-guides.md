I find myself needing to remember, how do I create a set of grid guides in Illustrator. As I’m a relatively new convert to using Illustrator, well I find myself switching between Illustrator and Photoshop, for much of the work I do. This is a quick tip to show you how to make a grid, for those who just can’t remember, due to it generally being easier to remember in Photoshop. In the post, I will cover how to create a simple grid and toggle its visibility.

## Add a rectangle the size of your artboard
The first step we need is to add a rectangle <kbd>m</kbd>.

## Split the shape into a grid
<figure>
<img src="/static/images/blog/split_grid.png" srcset="/static/images/blog/split_grid.png 1x, /static/images/blog/split_grid.png 2x">
<figcaption><p>Object > Path > Split Into Grid</p>
<p>Choose your options to create a grid suited to your needs.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

## Hiding the grid
Currently, the setup doesn’t allow you to hide the grid.

<figure>
<img src="/static/images/blog/make_guides.png" srcset="/static/images/blog/split_grid.png 1x, /static/images/blog/make_guides.png 2x">
<figcaption><p>With your  all your grid selected. Press <kbd>cmd + 5</kbd> or go to View > Guides > Make Guides</p></figcaption>
</figure>

You should now see your guides and be able to toggle them with cmd or <kbd>ctrl + ;</kbd>.
