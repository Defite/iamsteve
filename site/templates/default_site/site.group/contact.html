		<h2>Methods of contact</h2>
		<p>Use the contact form or {email} (twitter is an option also,) I'll try to reply within 24-48 hours. Should you not receive a reply within 24-48 hours, send your message again, because something will have gone wrong somewhere.</p>
		<h2>Availability</h2>
		<p>I'm currently unavailable for work. Though I will be available in the near future, so it's worth contacting me, and maybe we can arrange something. An idea of your project would be great too. If you're not too sure, I'm sure we'll be able to chat about it.</p>
		<p>However I don't accept projects with the design already done, to me it sets the wrong expectations from the start.</p>
