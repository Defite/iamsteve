		<h2>About myself</h2>
		<p>In short: I'm 23 and I graduated from university in May 2011. I have been doing this web thing fairly consistently from when I was about 12. I consider myself more user interface focused, though I enjoy everything about the design process. I aspire to be <em>half</em> decent at illustration, someday&hellip;</p>

		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Photoshop</dt>
			<dd>Although it's use isn't as prolific as it used to be, it's still a part of my workflow. You can't beat it for quickly experimenting with ideas and getting the larger part of the way a website should look and feel.</dd>
			<dt><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></dt>
			<dd>The starting point for the coding side any website is generally getting into the HTML. So it's obvious HTML should be in my skillset! I feel like this should be a given, but yes that includes HTML5 elements.</dd>
			<dt><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></dt>
			<dd>The stuff that makes a website come to life. I try to take a <abbr title="Don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> approach to my CSS. I use <a href="http://sass-lang.com" title="Syntactically awesome stylesheets">Sass</a> which I literally can't live without now. Another given I feel is I have great knowledge of CSS3. This means little for clients, but it helps me get my job done better.</dd>
			<dt>JavaScript/jQuery</dt>
			<dd>Always an area I'm looking to improve. I use it to enhance websites where it works best, be it a slider or something as simple as <a href="http://letteringjs.com" title="A tiny jQuery plugin to do cool web typography">lettering.js</a>.</dd>
			<dt>ExpressionEngine</dt>
			<dd>A CMS I adore, powerful in what it can do and a CMS which doesn't get in my way. It doesn't decide anything for me and lets me have full control over how <em>I</em> write the HTML. Which in turn helps me develop websites quicker! Also has a brilliant community behind it, you certainly get what you pay for.</dd>

		<h2>Old versions</h2>
		<p>Oh how we progress&hellip; <a href="http://dribbble.com/stevemckinney/projects/10419-My-site" title="Previous versions of my site taking shape on Dribbble">Dribbble</a> has been a good place for the most part to keep track of my previous designs (I should probably make a better effort in future to use it as a store for those). V2 onwards have links to blog posts explaining decisions.</p>
