		<h1>About myself</h1>
		<p>I'm 22 years old, and I have had many interests over the years, though none have appealed to me quite like designing and coding websites. I'm not sure what it was all those years ago that made me follow up a class in school using Microsoft Frontpage; to work out for myself how to design/code a website. Nonetheless it's stuck with me and I'm still as obsessed. The majority of my spare time is balanced between my wonderful girlfriend, self teaching and practice with design and code, my family (including pets), and friends.</p>

		<h1>In progress!</h1>
		<p>Writing an overview of myself is fairly difficult. It shall be here very soon!</p>
