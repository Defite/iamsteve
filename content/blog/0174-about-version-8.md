I had been wanting to redesign for a whileâ€”itâ€™s been more than enough time. The previous design had been in place since late 2016â€”along with iterations. I think the design held up well, but it was time for something new. And as with some form of tradition in writing about major changes here, I want to document some of the decisions.

## Goals
Thereâ€™s always goals when you set out to redesign outside of modernising the design and working towards something fresh.

### More flexibility with images
In terms of the design itself, I think there was aspects I felt limited with when it came to creating images. I wanted a reinvented colour palette. As I found it a challenge creating images with what I would define a richer feeling colour.

Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ve solved this, but I think itâ€™s in a better place.

### A new colour palette
As I look back at the design now it feels washed out, but it might be me. Screens have changed, trends have changed, my eyes have adjusted.

## Design
The design itself is a modernised version of what came before it. When I design something for myself or part of my own projects, I want to utilise the skills I have. Itâ€™s what makes it enjoyable.

I have evolved the design through the typography, illustration, colour and layout.

### Typography
Iâ€™ve opted to move to two sans serif typefaces. Theyâ€™re both groteskâ€™s, so they complement each other. Both are within the trends of where type is at currently.

Roc Grotesk has a strong presence, which I use for headings. The variety in widths and weights give a lot of freedom.

### Colour
The colour palette is familiar but renewed. I felt the older palette lacked some harmony.

### Working towards a digital garden
I like the idea of a digital garden. As Maggie Appleton says articles donâ€™t have to be something complete and can evolve. This is true with much of the web, if I look back at everything that exists here, I could rewrite it with more up to date techniques.

A digital garden promotes more evergreen writing and thatâ€™s something Iâ€™d like to do.

## Nothing much has changed with the structure
Overall, throughout the website it remains fairly similar. The homepage has a hero introduction, leading into latest posts and popular posts from the main categories.

## Rebuilding and moving to Next.js app router
As part of the last version I decided to move to Next.js. This was a learning curve and using the pages router.

However, for this redesign that was flipped on its head with app router. I was expecting to reuse some of the more challenging elements of initially moving to Next.js.

I did try to transition to app router from pages but for me it didnâ€™t work and as Vercel are clear this is the way forward I decided to do it from scratch.

### View counter
I spent an inordinate amount of time on the view trackingâ€”JavaScript development is not my best skill ðŸ˜…. I referenced a lot of Lee Robinsonâ€™s code as he had one in place, but there was a lot of figuring out required as I was using Supabase over Planetscale.

But this was much easier to setup view count sorting on the homepage which I wasnâ€™t able to achieve previously. Swings and roundabouts.

### Pagination
I felt pagination was surprisingly painful to do. I feel thereâ€™s some bugs in it but it seems to do the job. I referred to timlrxâ€™s theme for this and customised to my needs.

### Contentlayer
I discovered Contentlayer, which I really like from a publishing aspect. It adds a lot of flexibility to how you can get your content as there is a JSON representation of it.

You can also make your frontmatter typesafe, which is a nice benefit as I can force myself to make sure all needed frontmatter is present.

Otherwise Iâ€™m not bothered about types and typescript, itâ€™s too much for me.

### Better code highlighting
Another place I had a load of faff with getting builds to work on Netlify. But I think in the end this was down to the node version I was using on netlify even though I thought I was on a more up to date version.

I was resigned to using `rehype-pretty-code` but managed to get it all working with rehype-prism-plus. Which I was able to get a decent theme going, pretty code is far too limited in code highlighting.

And personally I find it easier to read when your brackets in html and jsx are the same colour as the tag.

## Using border-image for nicer borders

## Container queries to create large and medium sized cards

## Grid and sub-grid to manage layout

At the time of building this website, `subgrid` had become available, this means I can define the whole layout for the website from the `<body>`. Which makes it quite straightforward to orchestrate your layouts throughout breakpoints.

```css
grid-template-columns:
  [margin-start]
    var(--grid-margin)
    [container-start]
      repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))
      [content-start]
        repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))
        [prose-start]
          repeat(8, minmax(0, 1fr))
        [prose-end]
        repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))
      [content-end]
      repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))
    [container-end]
    var(--grid-margin)
  [margin-end];
```

I have defined a few layouts, but the one here is for larger screen layouts. I have a few points where I can decide where to place content.

I still have some things to learn with grid, but Iâ€™m fairly confident with it.

## Whatâ€™s next?
Thereâ€™s things I decided not to include for launch and spend more time figuring out how I want to approach. But this list comes down to a few things.

- Search
- Different homepage structure
- Notes section for updates and emerging articles
- Links archive
- Publishing new articles
