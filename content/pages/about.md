    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">Either you’re a developer wanting to improve their visual design skills, or a designer with some coding experience. You’re someone who understands the value of not only good design, but the requirement of making it look visually appealing too. Through sharing what I know and continue to learn, I hope to meet this need.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">
      A thing that has always driven my writing is hearing things like “you can’t expect your designs to look
      the same as they do in <em>design app</em>”. And while that comes from a good place, it’s always struck me as a way to avoid challenges and learning something new.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-3xl leading-3xl font-display font-variation-bold text-fern-1100 mb-2 pt-2">Changing aim over the years</h3>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">I made a decision to start writing this blog <em>consistently</em> in January 2015. Every week, for two years, a blog post went out. I started out writing about anything I was interested in, as long as it was related to websites.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">It became clear to me over those two years, there was a lack of content focusing on the visual side of design. It’s tough to teach, that’s why, or maybe that’s just me.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">As a designer, it’s the thing I aspire to be best at. And having this website as a place to explore and challenge myself. Through an approach where I consider the decisions I’m making—some of these are routine but are valuable.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">Eventually, I stopped posting frequently for various reasons. I’ve accepted I’ll always be figuring things out, but with a vision in mind I can work towards my goal. I hope I’ll post regularly again.</p>

    <h2 className="text-4xl leading-4xl font-display font-variation-bold text-fern-1100 mb-2 pt-6">About me</h2>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">I’m a designer based in Manchester. I specialise in visual design and user experience for websites. I’ve been doing this professionally for over 12 years. I’ve worked with a large variety of clients in differing industries. With differing needs, shops, subscriptions, services and marketing.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">I enjoy being involved along the whole timeline of a project. I’m someone who likes to get the best understanding possible and helps influence the solution. It helps build trust and avoids surprises. Looking at design end to end allows for decisions to be made quickly.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">Personally, I’ve been making websites from a young age. I learnt to code alongside designing—it was just part of the process. Debates like should designers code weren’t a thing when I was 13.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">As a designer, someone might ask if you have a personal style. I do feel I have a personal style, I enjoy serif typefaces, use of colour, an illustration style that has some depth but is generally flat. However, I will always design for the audience, goals and systems that are already in place.</p>

    <p className="text-ui-body mb-4 text-lg">I think it’s an enjoyment of creating things on the web. Be it icons, animation, illustration, CSS or JavaScript.</p>
